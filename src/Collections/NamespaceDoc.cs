    /// and querying documentation elements efficiently. The collections handle different aspects of documentation processing,

    /// <para>
    /// The namespace includes both mutable collection classes and read-only interfaces to support different usage patterns
    /// in the documentation pipeline. Collections provide specialized functionality such as case-insensitive lookups,
    /// wildcard pattern matching, and grouping of related documentation elements.
